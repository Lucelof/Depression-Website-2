                    <li><b>Shy/Covered:</b> Individuals who tend to be quiet, often because they have been bullied or insulted, perceive social interactions as more threatening than being alone.</li>
                    <li><b>Narcissistic and Selfish:</b> People who tend to be selfish, easily get angry at other people for no good reason, and often blame others when things don't go the way they think they should, can be more susceptible to depression.</li>
